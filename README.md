# EmbeddedSystemWS17
## The repository for the Embedded Systems WS17 lecture.

To learn about the basics of the object oriented programming (OOP) paradigma, 
the lecture held by Prof. Dr. Irene Rothe focusses on designing classic board games.
The code behind the games shall be written object oriented while fulfilling the 
elementary basics for OOP. For this the students are divided into small groups.
Every group has its own code to work on in the repository.
